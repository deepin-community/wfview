The Band tab:

The band tab reflects what bands the rig supports. It directly will
switch the rig to that band and you will be switched back to the View tab

the bands offered follow generally what the rig's capabilities are.
Some bands will either be RX only for some people (4m/60m/630m/2200m)

Band stacking gives you the opportunity to use the band stacking registers
which is filled by the rig itself.
