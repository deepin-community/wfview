I started to describe in text what all the controls are and what they 
actually are supposed to do. This is a very rough start of UI documentation 
and will beautify that of course. Initially want just to be sure that the 
definitions are right and everyone can edit/push it. So feel free.

Note that the markers that certainly are incomplete are marked TODO.
