buttons

spectrum scope/waterfall:

spectrum mode

depending on the rig you can select: 

center
fixed
scroll-center
scroll-fixed

spectrum span

the spectrum span is active in center modes and you can select
here the span you like, just as on the rig.

spectrum edge

here you can select the edge number as programmed in the rig.
Most rigs will accept four edges. 


tofixed

clear peaks

here you can clear the peaks. Currently we only support persistent
peaks and at some point we are changing that to be able to have it
go away after 10 seconds, like the rig does.

enable/disable wf

on/off switch for the scope/waterfall

wf theme

Currently fixed selections how the scope and waterfall look like 
with colors. At some point we may add the ability to accept the 
RGB values like the rig does.



mode


here you can select the mode used for tx and rx. To enable data mode there is 
a separate button to select.


Data mode

switch the D mode on/off on the selected mode.

receive (and tx) filter

Select the predefined filter settings of the rig.
Rigs also will change the TX width accordingly.

transmit/receive

this button alternates between TX and RX; Note that to 
enable TX, you need to do that first on the Settings tab

enable/disable atu

if your rig supports an internal ATU, you can enable
disable it here. Note that we have not tested external 
ATU's yet. It may follow, it may not...

enable/disable rit

Enable the RIT function; currently no feedback on the rx shift.

tune

Button to initiate the ATU. Note that we have not tested external
ATU's yet. It may follow, it may not...


repeater setup (expand)

TODO

preamp

You can select the preamp mode(s). Some rigs can only accept
preamp OR att.

attenuator

you can select the rig attenuator here. Some rigs can only accept
preamp OR att.


antenna selection

TODO 

controls

main dial (there is no sub dial yet)

by turning the dial, or using mouse wheel or clicking on the scope
you can change the current frequency. The step size is below the 
main dial and you can select most known stepsizes there.
An Flock button will effectively lock the freq to prevent accidental 
mis clicking/rotating mouse actions.
  

rit  dial

the rit dial will effectively modify the offset in RX; useful on the VHF
bands and up. Note that you need to switch on RIT for that
You can use the mouse wheel to change the offset/shift.

rf gain

This slider controls the RF gain of the rig

af gain (defaults to 100%

This controls the AF Gain locally, defaults to 100% and does not 
increase/decrease the AF gain on the rig itself. 
(Else, a remotely controlled rig could make a lot of noise ;-))

sq

The squelch control

tx power

Control that sets the power in % with the same accuracy as the rig
so if your rig is 50 Watt at 47%, this slider will too.

mic gain

The mic gain slider sets the modulation level on the rig.

scope reference level

The scope reference level can be set here and TODO because 
need to check if this follows per band or not.


=============================
Frequency

On this tab you can insert a free frequency in kHz.

examples:

7100 --> 7.1 kHz
430. --> 430 MHz

e.g. the dot itself defines currently that you specify MHz.
It will not accept anything beyond the dot. E.g. 430.125
will end up doing nothing.

After entering, you will be switched back to the View tab.

STO/RCL: TODO
